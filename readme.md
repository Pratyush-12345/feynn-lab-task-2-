![ss of app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40530cc3-9070-4370-8f13-89dbd6463d57)


## Overview

This project demonstrates a predictive analytics application designed to forecast patient no-shows for healthcare appointments. The prototype uses a Random Forest Classifier, trained on a dataset of medical appointments, and features a Streamlit-based web application for user interaction.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Processes and prepares the dataset for modeling, including feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of patient no-shows.
- **Streamlit App:** Provides a simple web interface for healthcare providers to input patient information and receive predictions on no-show probabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
